first ssh to lxplus (you're already here!), then

vncserver -localhost -nolisten tcp -geometry 1880x970 :2

2 is usually good, but sometimes you'll need to use 3 or 4 if 2 is taken
now open a new terminal from your laptop/desktop (i.e. not on lxplus) and do

ssh -fN -Y -L 5902:localhost:5902 ${USER}@lxplus070.cern.ch

where the "2" in 5902 matches the monitor number at the end of the command near the top (:2)
you also need to change your lxplus server number to match!!!
after you do that succesffully do this command (from local again)

xvnc4viewer localhost:2

once you're in (and you'll know if you're in) open a terminal and do this
(if it's your first time, you need to clone the repo, otherwise just cd and clean/start the GUI)

git clone git@github.com:cms-sw/hlt-confdb.git
cd hlt-confdb
ant clean && ./start #its best to do a full clean each time when starting the gui


other useful things
this kills a server when you're done with it (which is polite to do)

vncserver -kill :5902
