first ssh to lxplus (you're already here!)
then
vncserver -localhost -nolisten tcp -geometry 1880x970 :2
2 is usually good, but sometimes you'll need to use 3 or 4 if 2 is taken
now open a new terminal from your laptop/desktop (i.e. not on lxplus) and do
ssh -fN -Y -L 5902:localhost:5902 ${USER}@lxplus070.cern.ch
where the "2" in 5902 matches the monitor number at the end of the command near the top (:2)
you also need to change your lxplus server number to match!!!
after you do that succesffully do 
xvnc4viewer localhost:2
from local again

other useful things
vncserver -kill :5902
and
ps aux | grep ssh
and then
kill (whatever that id was)
